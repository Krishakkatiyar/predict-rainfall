# predict-rainfall
To complete the task, we need to perform several steps including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and improvement. Below is a structured approach to solve the problem statement.

Approach to Solving the Task
Understanding the Problem Statement:

Predicting rainfall is a binary classification problem where we need to predict if it will rain tomorrow (RainTomorrow) based on various weather-related features.
Loading and Preprocessing the Data:

Load the dataset.
Handle missing values.
Convert categorical variables to numerical ones if necessary.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand the distribution of the data.
Visualize correlations and feature importance.
Model Selection:

Use Decision Tree Classifier as the baseline model.
Use Ensemble Methods including Bagging, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Train each model on the training data.
Evaluate each model using accuracy and confusion matrix on the test data.
Compare the performance of each model.
Model Improvement:

Select the best performing model.
Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance.
Consider additional feature engineering or data augmentation if necessary.
Available ML Model Options
Decision Tree Classifier:

A simple and interpretable model which splits the data based on feature values to make predictions.
Random Forest Classifier:

An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Bagging Classifier:

Uses bootstrap aggregating to create multiple versions of a predictor and uses these to get an aggregated result.
Gradient Boosting Classifier:

An ensemble technique that builds trees sequentially, with each tree attempting to correct the errors of the previous one.
